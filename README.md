# How did IRA influence american politics?


# Abstract
In this project we will look for correlations between Twitter posts by the Internet Research Agency and variations in the US citizens opinion regarding politics. 
Our goal is to analyze the Internet Research Agencyâ€™s strategy, its efficiency and highlight the impact it had over the US national elections and other political events.

# Research questions 
- What themes, hashtags, politicians are mostly addressed?

- Has the writing style changed over time? Is it very different depending on the autor? 
- What strategies did IRA implement? 
- What sentiment is dominant in those tweets, is it constant over time?

# Dataset
We will use data from FiveThirtyEight containing nearly 3 million tweets sent from Twitter, all connected to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian "troll factory" and a defendant in an indictment filed by the Justice Department in February 2018, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The tweets in this database were sent between February 2012 and May 2018, with the vast majority posted from 2015 through 2017.
