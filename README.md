# Dataset
We use data from FiveThirtyEight containing nearly 3 million tweets sent from Twitter, all connected to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian "troll factory" and a defendant in an indictment filed by the Justice Department in February 2018, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The tweets in this database were sent between February 2012 and May 2018, with the vast majority posted from 2015 through 2017.

# Actual state
The data is loaded, and explored. We used several different visualisation and analysis tools. Some aspect are still under developpement as we aim to have the finest explanation for each phenomenon we observe. We tackled different part of the probleme and next step is the detailled reasonning behind all our visualisations.
